# Product Decisions

Features that are staying. Don't question their existence — improve them.

## Essential, Will Expand

- **Hot-reload** — core dev workflow. Import discipline cost is accepted.
- **Tmux integration** — used every session. Foundation for deeper integration.
- **Filterset presets** — staying, may evolve.
- **Visibility system** — the core UX model. 5 states implemented: hidden, summary collapsed, summary expanded, full collapsed, full expanded (of 8 possible).
- **HAR recording/replay** — persistence layer, source of truth.
- **Two-stage pipeline** (formatting → rendering) — architectural spine.
