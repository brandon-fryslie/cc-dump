## Key Facts Gathered

### Sprint Commits (ef94441..b2c11ac)
4 commits implementing 3 tickets:
- ef94441: first_changed tracking (cc-dump-ax6)
- 53dfaad: _widest_strip caching (cc-dump-e38)
- 8a5f78e: incremental offset recalc (cc-dump-0oo)
- b2c11ac: 4 new tests

At commit b2c11ac, all 27 widget tests passed, 322 total tests passed.

### Post-Sprint Commits
- 30ddd67: Marked beads tickets as closed
- fc9318b: "feat(analytics): add ToolEconomicsRow and get_tool_economics query"

### CRITICAL: Commit fc9318b Destroyed Phase 1 Implementation
Commit fc9318b modified widget_factory.py from 973 lines to 23 lines (net -1133 lines).
This commit deleted:
- `TurnData` class (entire dataclass including `_widest_strip` field)
- `ConversationView` class (entire virtual scrolling widget including `_recalculate_offsets_from`, `rerender`, etc.)
- `_compute_widest()` helper function
- All streaming methods
- All filter/rerender logic

The classes were NOT moved to another file. They are gone from the codebase entirely.

### Current Test State (HEAD = fc9318b)
```
ERROR tests/test_widget_arch.py - ImportError: cannot import name 'TurnData'
ERROR tests/test_scroll_nav.py - ImportError (similar)
```
Two test files fail to collect. The full test suite cannot run.

### Working Tree
Clean (only one untracked file: tests/test_tool_economics.py). All damage is committed.

### Irony
Commit fc9318b also wrote the WORK-EVALUATION-20260203.md and IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE-20260203.md files that document Phase 1 as "COMPLETE" and "All Working", while the same commit deleted the implementation.

### Previous Evaluation (EVALUATION-20260203-033729.md)
Pre-implementation evaluation at commit a11672a. Correctly identified 0% complete, catalogued all 7 strip-assignment sites, identified key risks. All recommendations were followed during implementation.

### DOD Verification (from WORK-EVALUATION-20260203.md)
At the time of sprint completion (b2c11ac), all 36 DOD checkboxes were verified as passing with specific file:line evidence. The work evaluation was thorough and non-tautological.
