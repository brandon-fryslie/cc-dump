This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where content has been compressed (code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter).

<file_summary>
This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
</usage_guidelines>

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: src/textual/messages.py
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Content has been compressed - code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)
